## Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing

**File:** [0-positive_or_negative.py](./0-positive_or_negative.py)  
**Concept:** Conditional statements to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

## Task 1: The last digit

**File:** [1-last_digit.py](./1-last_digit.py)  
**Concept:** Conditional statements and modulo operation to find and evaluate the last digit of a number.

## Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

**File:** [2-print_alphabet.py](./2-print_alphabet.py)  
**Concept:** Looping through ASCII values to print the alphabet.

## Task 3: When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

**File:** [3-print_alphabt.py](./3-print_alphabt.py)
